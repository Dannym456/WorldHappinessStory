# World Happiness Story

Hello! This is my world happiness analysis using world happiness report dataset and many other datasets to paint a better idea of what really drives happiness up or down. 

If you are just interested in exploring the dashboards and the story then please feel free downloading the world happiness tableau packaged workbook.
```bash
World_Happiness_Project
```

For those who are interested in downloading the packaged workbook as well as all of the datasets used then please download the .Rar file and upzip in which ever location you feel comfortable. *Just make sure that the tableau workbook is in the same folders as the datasets for ease of use*

## Rserve implementation

For the linear regression aspect of this project, I used the RGui to help run some packages and then would connect my instance of Tableau to R. Please follow this link to the download "http://cran.us.r-project.org/"

After the installation please open your version of *RGui* and type in the following commands:
```bash
install.packages("Rserve")
library(Rserve);
Rserve()
```
After all of that is done, please go to Tableau and follow along with the pictures.

Depending on your version of Tableau this might look different, but as long as you set up the port and the hostname to what is displayed then you should be fine.
